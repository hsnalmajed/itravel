/**
 * One trip, priced — not a wall of near-identical packages.
 *
 * A flight list crossed with a hotel list produces twenty-five cards that
 * differ by a few riyals, and a visitor has to hold all of them in their head
 * to work out what any one choice costs. So we make the decision for them
 * first: the cheapest flight with the cheapest hotel, shown as a single trip
 * with a single total.
 *
 * Everything else is reachable, but as an *answer to a question*: "what else
 * is there, and what would it cost me?" Each alternative is labelled with its
 * difference from the option currently selected — +٤٥٠ ر.س for the earlier
 * flight, ٠ for a hotel at the same rate — because that difference is the
 * number someone is actually deciding on. An absolute price makes them do the
 * subtraction themselves, every time.
 *
 * The deltas are recomputed against whatever is selected now, not against the
 * original cheapest option, so after swapping the flight the hotel list still
 * reads as "compared with what I have".
 *
 * Every offer is scanned rather than read: the carrier's logo, a departure
 * and arrival time joined by a line, then two chips that answer the only
 * questions a fare list gets asked — does it stop, and is a bag included.
 * What a traveller compares on is never left in the same grey as everything
 * else.

/**
 * The alternatives, as a dialog over the page.
 *
 * Swapping a flight is a comparison, and a comparison wants the screen to
 * itself: inline, the list pushed the trip card up and the traveller lost
 * sight of the thing they were comparing against. As an overlay the trip
 * stays put underneath, the list gets the full height, and picking an option
 * closes it and returns them exactly where they were.
 *
 * It behaves the way a dialog is expected to — Escape closes it, so does a
 * click on the backdrop, the page behind it stops scrolling while it is open,
 * and focus moves into it so a keyboard lands inside the list rather than
 * somewhere back up the page.
