 * The shape the four trust pages share.
 *
 * About, contact, privacy and terms are the pages a visitor checks when they
 * are deciding whether a site is a real business — which on a travel site
 * they are deciding before they trust a price. They had no reason to differ
 * from each other, and four hand-built pages would have drifted.
 *
 * Deliberately plain: no hero photograph, a narrow measure, and generous
 * line height. These are pages to be read, and a photograph of a mountain
 * above a liability clause is a small lie about what the page is.
