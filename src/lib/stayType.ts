// What kind of place the party is sleeping in.
//
// The search forms used to offer six choices — single, twin, double, triple,
// suite, apartment — which is the vocabulary a hotel's revenue manager uses,
// not the one a traveller does. Someone booking for five people does not want
// to work out whether that is "triple" or "suite"; they want to know whether
// they are getting a room or an apartment.
//
// So the question the customer answers is the short one, and the party size
// answers the rest. Four people fit in a family room; six do not, and there is
// no honest way to show them one. When the party is too big for a room the
// choice collapses to an apartment on its own and the form says why, rather
// than letting someone pick something that cannot be booked.
//
// The concrete RoomType is still what leaves in the URL, because that is what
// the hotel API and the offer data speak. This module is the translation.
