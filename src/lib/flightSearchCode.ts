/**
 * The trip, written the way the flight widget reads it.
 *
 * The White Label search box takes its starting values from one query
 * parameter on the page it loads in — `?flightSearch=RUH1611IST23112` — and,
 * when that parameter is there, runs the search itself. That string is the
 * whole reason the traveller does not have to type their trip a second time:
 * they tell us where and when once, on our own form, and the live results for
 * exactly those dates are already on screen when the page opens.
 *
 * The shape is positional, with no separators:
 *
 *     RUH 16 11 IST 23 11 2
 *     │   │  │  │   │  │  └── seats
 *     │   │  │  │   └──┴───── date home, day then month
 *     │   │  │  └───────────── where to
 *     │   └──┴──────────────── date out, day then month
 *     └──────────────────────── where from
 *
 * A one-way trip simply leaves the second date out. The year is not in it at
 * all: the widget reads a day-and-month as the next time that date comes
 * round, which is what a traveller means by "16 November" anyway.
