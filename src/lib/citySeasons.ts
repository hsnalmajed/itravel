// When each city is in season — from its own measured weather.
//
// The country guides carry a hand-written "best months" line, and for a
// country that spans a continent's worth of climate that line is only ever
// right for some of it: Antalya in October is not Istanbul in October, and
// Salalah's monsoon summer is Muscat's furnace. So the season is decided per
// city, from two numbers a traveller actually feels, both averaged over
// twenty years of NASA's daily record for that city's coordinates (see
// src/data/cityClimate.ts for the source and how it was collected):
//
//   - the typical afternoon high (mean daily maximum, °C)
//   - the days in the month with at least 1 mm of rain
//
// A month is "in season" for a city when both are comfortable:
//
//   18 °C ≤ afternoon high ≤ 32 °C,  and  rainy days ≤ 8.
//
// The band is deliberately wider on the warm side than a European guide's
// would be — the people using this live with Gulf summers — and the rule is
// printed on the page with the numbers beside every city, so nobody has to
// take "in season" on trust.
