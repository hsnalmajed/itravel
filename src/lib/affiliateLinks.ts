/**
 * Where a traveller actually goes to pay.
 *
 * Sfrtna never takes a booking or a payment — it compares, and then hands
 * over. That handover is the entire business model, and for a while it did
 * not exist: the button said "view details & book", the details page had no
 * booking control on it, and this module sat in the tree with nothing
 * importing it. A metasearch site with no way out to a partner is a
 * catalogue.
 *
 * Two rules the links below follow:
 *
 *  - **Only real, public URL shapes.** Booking.com's `searchresults.html`
 *    and Skyscanner's `/transport/flights/<from>/<to>/<yymmdd>/` are
 *    documented, stable entry points. Nothing here invents a deep link to a
 *    specific offer, because we cannot know the partner still has it — the
 *    link opens *their* search for the same trip, and the UI says so.
 *  - **The partner sets the price.** Every caller of this module has to
 *    print that alongside the button. Our number came from a different
 *    source and may be minutes or days old.
 *
 * The partner ids are public tags that travel in the query string of a URL
 * the visitor's own browser opens — they are not secrets, so they are read
 * from NEXT_PUBLIC_* and work in the browser. Without them the links still
 * work; they just earn nothing.
