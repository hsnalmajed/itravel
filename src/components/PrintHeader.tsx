 * The letterhead on everything the site prints.
 *
 * A plan saved as a PDF leaves the site and gets sent to whoever is coming on
 * the trip. Up to now it left as an anonymous sheet of black text — no mark on
 * it, nothing to say where it came from. So every printed document opens on
 * the logo, the navy rule and the orange band, and closes on the same note it
 * would in the browser.
 *
 * Invisible on screen and only drawn for print, which is why it carries no
 * layout cost on a page nobody prints.
 *
 * The logo is a plain <img> from /public: the app runs with Next's image
 * optimizer disabled on Workers, and a print stylesheet is no place for a
 * component that might lazy-load.
