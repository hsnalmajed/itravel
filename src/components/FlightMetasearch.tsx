/**
 * Real flight results, inside our own page.
 *
 * Travelpayouts' live Search API is gated behind 50,000 monthly users, which
 * a new site does not have and cannot get without something worth visiting.
 * Their White Label widget is the way out of that circle: the same live
 * search Aviasales runs — every airline and agency it covers, for the exact
 * dates asked — rendered into these two containers on our own domain, in our
 * own colours, with the booking click credited to us.
 *
 * So the site keeps the part that is ours (a budget, a destination, a plan)
 * and stops pretending to be a search engine it cannot yet be. When the
 * traffic clears their threshold we swap this for the API and draw the
 * results ourselves; nothing the traveller sees has to change.
 *
 * The script is loaded once, on the pages that actually show flights — it is
 * a third-party module and has no business on a page about visas.
 *
 * This block belongs on the results page and nowhere else. It was briefly on
 * the homepage too, back when a search in the widget navigated to the site
 * root and the tickets needed a container waiting there. The `flightSearch`
 * parameter made that unnecessary — the search now runs and renders in place
 * — and a front page whose job is to make someone want to travel does not
 * open with a second search form under the one it already has.
 *
 * `tone` survives from that experiment: "dark" boxes the widget in white on
 * a navy background. Nothing uses it today; it costs nothing and saves
 * rebuilding it if a dark section ever wants the widget.
