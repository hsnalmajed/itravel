/**
 * The Sfrtna logo — the owner's artwork, used exactly as supplied.
 *
 * The master file lives in /brand/sfrtna-logo-master.png. Nothing here is
 * redrawn, recoloured or re-set. Two files are derived from it, and both
 * derivations are mechanical:
 *
 *   "full"  the whole signature — pin, wordmark and «لكل سفره حكاية» — with
 *           only the empty white margin trimmed off and the file scaled to
 *           roughly three times its largest display size.
 *   "mark"  the pin with its sun, trail and plane, lifted out of the same
 *           artwork for the square slots a wordmark cannot fill: the browser
 *           tab, the home-screen icon, link previews. The plane and the
 *           wordmark are separated by a clean 24px gap in the master, so the
 *           icon comes out whole without any of its own pixels being touched.
 *
 * The artwork is on white and the wordmark is navy, so on dark surfaces it
 * sits on a white card rather than being recoloured. Reversing it would also
 * repaint the navy inside the pin, and the mark would stop being the mark.
