 * job, which is to make someone want to go somewhere, and that argument is
 * won by places a Saudi traveller already half-wants — Istanbul, Tbilisi,
 * the Maldives — not by whichever country sorts first alphabetically.
 *
 * Nine, not ten. The first card spans two columns and two rows, so the grid
 * only comes out flush when the remaining eight exactly fill what is left:
 * 2 cols → 4+8 = 12 cells over 6 rows; 3 cols → 12 over 4 rows; 6 cols → 12
 * over 2 rows. Ten destinations left a visible hole at every width.

          The photograph and the planner, together.

          The photograph is its own fixed slab, pinned to the top of the
          section, and the content flows over it. It used to be stretched to
          whatever height the section happened to be — and the section's
          height is the planner's height, which changes every time someone
          switches to "hotels only" or opens the extra options. So the picture
          silently re-cropped on every click: it looked like the background
          was zooming in and out under the form. A fixed slab cannot do that.

          The content is no longer vertically centred either. Centring inside
          a box whose height is set by that same content means a tall form
          pushes the headline up underneath the fixed header. It starts below
          the header and grows downwards, where there is room. */}
