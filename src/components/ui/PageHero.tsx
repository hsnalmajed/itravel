/**
 * The one hero every inner page wears.
 *
 * Before this existed each page invented its own banner — a flat navy bar
 * here, a gradient there — which is the single biggest reason the site read
 * as a set of unrelated screens. Now the shape is fixed: a real photograph
 * of the place, the navy scrim, an eyebrow, the title, and an optional row
 * of facts. Only the picture and the words change.
 *
 * `photo` is optional on purpose. Wikipedia is the source for most of these
 * images and it goes down; when it does the hero falls back to a navy
 * gradient with the same proportions, so the page loses its picture without
 * losing its composition.
 *
 * `photoSrcSet` and `photoCredit` travel together and both come from
 * sectionHero(): a hero is the page's largest paint, so it is worth handing a
 * 4K screen the 4K rendering, and the licences these photographs carry are
 * conditional on naming the photographer. Neither is optional in practice —
 * they are optional in the type only because the country pages still pass a
 * discovered Wikipedia photo, which has no credit metadata to print.
